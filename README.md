[00:00.81] Baddest do, what the baddest do (hey)
[00:03.77] The baddest do (hey), we the baddest, ooh
[00:07.13] Baddest do, what the baddest do (hey)
[00:10.18] The baddest do (hey), we the baddest
[00:28.18] 
[00:12.71] Coming at you live, real, real wild
[00:15.94] Here to light it up, set the world on fire
[00:19.22] Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
[00:22.91] 'Cause that's what the baddest do
[00:39.41] 
[00:25.66] Never going back, nah, not that
[00:28.66] Diamonds on drip 'cause I came to make a splash
[00:31.85] Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
[00:35.71] 'Cause that's what the baddest do (yeah, uh)
[00:57.71] 
[00:38.18] I spit heat, I melt your face off
[00:40.42] Disappear, I'm your eraser (yeah)
[00:42.09] In the cut just like a razor
[00:43.53] Murder business, where my blazer?
[00:45.12] I got all the boys on me
[00:46.77] I got all the lines on ring
[00:48.39] Knock 'em dead, turnin' heads
[00:50.00] I got all the eyes on me
[01:02.00] 
[00:51.61] Pretty face 걸어들어와, 유행 선두자
[00:54.62] 원하지만 못하잖아, 애가 타잖아
[00:58.02] You like, "Whoa, 'Kali, you the G.O.A.T."
[00:59.90] 난 알지 I know
[01:01.19] 준비해 'cause I like to ball, 멈추지 않아
[01:17.69] 
[01:04.37] 나는 lit, 크게 like a bit, 그거 말고 byte
[01:07.56] 믿어봐 큰 만큼 크게, 어깨 펴고 high
[01:10.74] 백 퍼센트, 덤비지 못해 죽여주잖아
[01:13.91] 나는 boss, 간지 with the sauce, 원하면 줄게
[01:30.91] 
[01:17.37] I'm doing damage, went just how I planned it
[01:20.41] I do what I want when I say (when I say, when I say)
[01:23.52] 모두 날 따라 해, 난 끝내주잖아
[01:26.94] To live on the edge of insane
[01:41.44] 
[01:29.44] Coming at you live, real, real wild
[01:32.81] Here to light it up, set the world on fire
[01:35.85] Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
[01:39.78] 'Cause that's what the baddest do
[01:56.28] 
[01:42.33] Never going back, nah, not that
[01:45.46] Diamonds on drip 'cause I came to make a splash
[01:48.65] Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
[01:52.59] 'Cause that's what the baddest do
[01:54.92] It's crazy
[01:59.92] 
[01:56.56] Sorry for the bad news, sorry I'm so bad
[01:59.77] Only took a minute for me to get what you had
[02:03.05] Sorry for the bad news, know it makes you sad
[02:06.16] I'll be here for a minute, baby
[02:07.90] You should pack your bags
[02:20.40] 
[02:08.87] Way that I look should be breaking the law
[02:10.43] If I don't got it, I take what I want
[02:12.00] My circle small like a round of applause
[02:13.48] You know that I love the sound of applause
[02:34.48] 
[02:15.15] You know I mean everything that I say
[02:16.52] When you see me coming, get out of the way
[02:18.30] I came to slay, I came to slay
[02:19.96] Back and I'm better and ready to stay
[02:38.46] 
[02:21.61] I'm doing damage, went just how I planned it
[02:24.67] I do what I want when I say (when I say, when I say)
[02:27.51] 모두 날 따라 해, 난 끝내주잖아
[02:31.06] To live on the edge of insane
[02:33.38] It's crazy
[02:38.38] 
[02:34.89] Sorry, not sorry for being the best
[02:36.37] 언제든지 내가 좀 해
[02:38.10] Look at the gold all on my chest
[02:39.73] Look at the gold, call it a flex
